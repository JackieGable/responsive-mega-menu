# Basic Usage
After downloading, <code>run npm install</code> and then run <code>gulp serve</code> which will start a local server and preview the template in your browser, watching for changes and live reload the browser when you made some changes. The file <strong>index.html</strong>, <strong>assets/js/script.js</strong> and files inside the <strong>scss</strong> folder are the only files you need to worry about and you can ignore everything else.
